            Write only visible non-space Glyph cells.

        - AuthoredOnly:
            Write all authored Glyph cells, including U' '.
            Skips Empty cells.

        - SolidObject:
            Write the full source object footprint.
            Glyph cells write normally.
            Empty cells participate as clearing authored spaces.
